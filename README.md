# AngularJS Skip Filter

    {{array | skip:skipCount}}

Returns an array without the specified amount of elements, removing them from the beggining

## Installation
This filter can be installed through [Bower](http://twitter.github.io/bower):

    bower install angular-platanus-skip-filter

For ease of including dependencies in your project, I recommend [Grunt-Bower-Install](https://github.com/stephenplusplus/grunt-bower-install).
